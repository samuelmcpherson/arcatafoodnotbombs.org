# Announcements: 
We are looking for more houses to cook at, to spread both the love and the impact on utilities/space. An eligible cooking space would be somewhere with enough space for people with chopping boards, boxes of veggies and musical instruments to congregate from 1-4 on Sundays. 

It also needs to have an oven, and a stove able to handle at least one big pot and possibly a wok. There is an ever changing cast of cooks so interested cooking spaces need to be prepared for new people showing up every week (though there is a core group of regulars who will make sure clean up happens etc).

# Upcoming Events: 
## Free meals at the [Arcata Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arcata+Plaza/@40.8685473,-124.0886259,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x54d1570f71afcedf:0xdf0d7f456c156cfe!8m2!3d40.8685473!4d-124.0864372!16s%2Fg%2F11c5t29lq4) every Sunday from 4PM to 5PM
