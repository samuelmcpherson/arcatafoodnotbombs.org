# Food Not Bombs in Arcata

We are a group of volunteers that recover and share free vegan food with the public to protest war, poverty, and the destruction of the environment.

Free vegan meals are available for all people every Sunday at 4 at the [Arcata Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arcata+Plaza/@40.8685473,-124.0886259,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x54d1570f71afcedf:0xdf0d7f456c156cfe!8m2!3d40.8685473!4d-124.0864372!16s%2Fg%2F11c5t29lq4).
