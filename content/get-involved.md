Food Not Bombs Arcata is looking for volunteers, advocates and allies. We glean produce from the co-op and give out free vegan meals every Sunday on the Arcata Plaza at 4PM.

Anyone can stop by to help serve food with us and this is a great way to meet the group and start helping.

We are always looking for volunteers to join us for any role during our Sunday schedule:

12:30PM: picking up food from the co-op

1PM - 3:45PM: Prepping and cooking food

3:50PM - 5PM: Setting up and serving food in the plaza

5PM: Cleanup and dishes
