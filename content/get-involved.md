Food Not Bombs Arcata is looking for volunteers, advocates and allies. We glean produce from the co-op and give out free vegan meals every Sunday on the [Arcata Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arcata+Plaza/@40.8685473,-124.0886259,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x54d1570f71afcedf:0xdf0d7f456c156cfe!8m2!3d40.8685473!4d-124.0864372!16s%2Fg%2F11c5t29lq4) at 4PM.

Anyone can stop by to help serve food with us and this is a great way to meet the group and start helping.
