      <description>About Food Not Bombs Food Not Bombs is an all-volunteer movement that recovers food that would otherwise be discarded, and shares free vegan and vegetarian meals with the hungry in over 1,000 cities in 65 countries in protest to war, poverty, and destruction of the environment.
We arrange the collection of produce, bread and other food that can&amp;rsquo;t be sold from grocery stores, bakeries, and produce markets. They put this food to the side and we pick it up at a scheduled time.</description>

      <description>Announcements: We are looking for more houses to cook at, to spread both the love and the impact on utilities/space. An eligible cooking space would be somewhere with enough space for people with chopping boards, and boxes of veggies to congregate from 1-4 on Sundays.
It also needs to have an oven, and a stove able to handle at least one big pot and possibly a wok. There is an ever changing cast of cooks so interested cooking spaces need to be prepared for new people showing up every week (though there is a core group of regulars who will make sure clean up happens etc).</description>

      <description>Food Not Bombs Arcata is looking for volunteers, advocates and allies. We glean produce from the co-op and give out free vegan meals every Sunday on the Arcata Plaza at 4PM.
Anyone can stop by to help serve food with us and this is a great way to meet the group and start helping.
We are always looking for volunteers to join us for any role during our Sunday schedule:</description>
